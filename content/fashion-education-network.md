Our mission is to bridge the gap between education and the industry and help set international standards that could benefit schools, students and eventually the global industry.
 
- When it comes to developing talents and skills and connecting with the next generation of industry professionals, the Fashion Education Network wants to contribute by providing free information and resources.
